# File: Verbosity.py
# Requires python v3.5.3 or later
#
# NAMING CONVENTIONS:
#
# TypeIdentifiers are CamelCase
# CONSTANTS are CAPITAL_CASE
# all_other_identifiers are snake_case
# _protected members begin with a single underscore '_' (subclasses can access)
# __private members begin with double underscore: '__'
#
# python more or less enfores the double-underscore as private
# by prepending the class name to those identifiers. That makes
# it difficult (but not impossible) for other classes to access
# those identifiers.
